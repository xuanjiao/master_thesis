abstract = {We present Antlab, an end-to-end system that takes streams of user task requests and executes them using collections of robots. In Antlab, each request is specified declaratively in linear temporal logic extended with quantifiers over robots. The user does not program robots individually, nor know how many robots are available at any time or the precise state of the robots. The Antlab runtime system manages the set of robots, schedules robots to perform tasks, automatically synthesizes robot motion plans from the task specification, and manages the co-ordinated execution of the plan.We provide a constraint-based formulation for simultaneous task assignment and plan generation for multiple robots working together to satisfy a task specification. In order to scalably handle multiple concurrent tasks, we take a separation of concerns view to plan generation. First, we solve each planning problem in isolation, with an “ideal world” hypothesis that says there are no unspecified dynamic obstacles or adversarial environment actions. Second, to deal with imprecisions of the real world, we implement the plans in receding horizon fashion on top of a standard robot navigation stack. The motion planner dynamically detects environment actions or dynamic obstacles from the environment or from other robots and locally corrects the ideal planned path. It triggers a re-planning step dynamically if the current path deviates from the planned path or if planner assumptions are violated.We have implemented Antlab as a C++ and Python library on top of robots running on ROS, using SMT-based and AI planning-based implementations for task and path planning. We evaluated Antlab both in simulation as well as on a set of TurtleBot robots. We demonstrate that it can provide a scalable and robust infrastructure for declarative multi-robot programming.},

abstract = { Task allocation is an important aspect of many multi-robot systems. The features and complexity of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems are dictated by the requirements of the particular domain under consideration. These problems can range from those involving instantaneous distribution of simple, independent tasks among members of a homogenous team, to those requiring the time-extended scheduling of complex interrelated multi-step tasks for members of a heterogenous team related by several constraints. The existing widely used taxonomy for task allocation in multi-robot systems was designed for problems with independent tasks and does not deal with problems with interrelated utilities and constraints. While that taxonomy was a ground-breaking contribution to the MRTA literature, a survey of recent work in MRTA reveals that it is no longer a sufficient taxonomy, due to the increasing importance of interrelated utilities and constraints in realistic MRTA problems under consideration. Thus, in this paper, we present a new, comprehensive taxonomy, iTax, that explicitly takes into consideration the issues of interrelated utilities and constraints. Our taxonomy maps categories of MRTA problems to existing mathematical models from combinatorial optimization and operations research, and hence draws important parallels between robotics and these fields. }

The main contribution of this paper is a specific categorization of problems that have temporal and ordering constraints. We propose a novel taxonomy that emphasizes the differences between temporal and ordering constraints, and organizes the current literature according to the nature of those constraints. We summarize widely used models and methods from the task allocation literature and related areas, such as vehicle routing and scheduling problems, showing similarities and differences."

abstract = "Daily life assistance is one of the most important applications for service robots. For comfortable assistance, service robots must recognize the surrounding conditions correctly, including human motion, the position of objects, and obstacles. However, since the everyday environment is complex and unpredictable, it is almost impossible to sense all of the necessary information using only a robot and sensors attached to it. In order to realize a service robot for daily life assistance, we have been developing an informationally structured environment using distributed sensors embedded in the environment. The present paper introduces a service robot system with an informationally structured environment referred to the ROS–TMS. This system enables the integration of various data from distributed sensors, as well as storage of these data in an on-line database and the planning of the service motion of a robot using real-time information about the surroundings. In addition, we discuss experiments such as detection and fetch-and-give tasks using the developed real environment and robot."

abstract="Nowadays robot simulators have robust physics engines, high-quality graphics, and convenient interfaces, affording researchers to substitute physical systems with their simulation models in order to pre-estimate the performance of theoretical findings before applying them to real robots. This paper describes Gazebo simulation approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on Robot Operating System (ROS) using PR2 robot. The ROS-based SLAM approach applies Rao-Blackwellized particle filters and laser data to locate the PR2 robot in unknown environment and build a map. The real room 3D model was obtained from camera shots and reconstructed with Autodesk 123D Catch and MeshLab software. The results demonstrate the fidelity of the simulated 3D room to the obtained from the robot laser system ROS-calculated map and the feasibility of ROS-based SLAM with a Gazebo-simulated mobile robot to its usage in camera-based 3D environment. This approach will be further extended to ROS-based robotic simulations in Gazebo with a Russian anthropomorphic robot AR-601M.",

In this study, we consider the two constituent sub-problems of Grid scheduling, namely: (i) the scheduling of computation tasks to processing resources and (ii) the routing and scheduling of the data movement in a Grid network. Regarding computation tasks, we examine two typical online task scheduling algorithms that employ advance reservations and perform full network simulation experiments to measure their performance when implemented in a centralized or distributed manner. Similarly, for communication tasks, we compare two routing and data scheduling algorithms that are implemented in a centralized or a distributed manner. We examine the effect network propagation delay has on the performance of these algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that a distributed architecture with an exhaustive resource utilization update strategy yields better average end-to-end delay performance than a centralized architecture."

abstract="Multi-robot systems are widely employed in various applications including industrial plant inspection. However, current research work mainly focuses on the methods of object detection, and rarely addresses task allocation and path-planning of multi-robot systems for industrial plant inspection. Therefore, a centralized method for multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) and path-planning to solve inspection problems is proposed in this paper. For the first time, the problem statement of the task allocation for inspection problems is formulated. This paper introduces the implementation of the algorithm based on A* and a novel Genetic Algorithm including the environment representation. The task allocation and path-planning are performed based on the assumption that the robots work in known environments. The proposed algorithm is tested in a simulation study derived from a large industrial site.",
