I would like to begin by thanking my supervisor Dr. Matteo Zella and Carlos Medina Sanchez. Their strict attitude and enthusiasm for research have encouraged me. Many thanks for their reading and examining my thesis. I can not finish my thesis without their guidance.

I also would like to thank all the people who have supported me during writing. I am so lucky to study at the University Duisburg-Essen.
