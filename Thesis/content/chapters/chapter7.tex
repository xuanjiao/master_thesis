I would like to begin by thanking my supervisor Dr. Matteo Zella and Carlos Medina SÃ¡nchez. Their strict attitude and enthusiasm to research has encouraged me. Many thanks for their reading and examining on my thesis. I can not finish my thesis without their guidance.

I also would like to thank all the people who have supported me during writing. I am so luck to study in the University Duisburg-Essen.
